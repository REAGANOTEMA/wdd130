    <p>Hello, I’m Reagan Otema, a software development student at BYU–Idaho currently enrolled in WDD 130 – Web Fundamentals. I’m passionate about learning web design and development to build functional and user-friendly websites.

Originally from Jinja, Uganda, I bring a background in entrepreneurship and teamwork from my experience in outdoor adventure tourism. I’m excited to apply these skills to my studies and future career in software development.

    <p>Uganda, the Pearl of Africa, is known for its breathtaking landscapes, vibrant wildlife, and rich cultural heritage. It’s home to the world’s second-largest freshwater lake — Lake Victoria — and the mighty Nile River, which begins its journey right here in Jinja. From lush green hills to roaring rapids, Uganda is a paradise for adventurers and nature lovers alike.</p>
